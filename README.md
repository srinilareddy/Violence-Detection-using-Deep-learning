# Violence-Detection-using-Deep-learning
Violence is a major social problem that can have devastating 
consequences for individuals and communities. Real-time violence 
detection systems can help to prevent violence by identifying and 
responding to violent incidents in real time. The proposed real-time 
violence detection system has the potential to be a valuable tool for 
preventing violence in a variety of settings, such as schools, 
workplaces, and public spaces. The objective of this project is to 
develop a real-time violence detection system that can accurately 
identify violent incidents in surveillance video streams. It will use a 
combination of Deep Learning algorithms such as CNN, LSTM and 
Computer Vision techniques to extract features from surveillance 
video streams and classify them as violent or non-violent. The system 
will be trained on a large dataset of labelled surveillance videos. Real 
Life Violent Videos Dataset is used for this purpose which has 1000 
violent videos and 1000 non-violent videos. Once trained, the system 
will be able to detect violence in real time with high accuracy
